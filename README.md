# E-I Net

E-I Net is a spiking neural circuit model that learns sparse code representations such as found in the brain.
E-I Net models aspects of the pattern-learning neural networks found the cerebral cortex by using separate
populations of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons to find statistical patterns in an input information space.
Using only unsupervised learning (i.e. no training or reference signal), E-I Net learns Gabor-like
receptive fields such as those found in primary visual cortex (area V1).
The spiking circuit simulator is written in MATLAB.

This work was done at the UC Berekeley Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience and
is an evolution of SAILnet by Joel Zylberberg.

FAQ: The motivation behind E-I Net is described in the [E-I Net FAQ](https://www.pking.org/research/EINet/ei_net_faq.html).

Documentation: The inner workings of E-I Net's spiking circuit simulator is explained in this

Source code: The E-I Net source code and the spiking circuit simulator on which it is based (Neurosim)
is written in MATLAB and can be downloaded from GitHub (here) or as a zipfile.
